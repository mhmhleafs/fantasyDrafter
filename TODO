1. figure out how to use 20202021-20232024 to get avg xg (weighted by gp)
2. also get actual g
3. calculate normal gAboveXG
4. predict 20242025 g
5. compare predicted g and shp regression as models

6. project assists?

7. factor age into the variables
8. logistic regression to weigh age, g, gAboveXG, xg???
